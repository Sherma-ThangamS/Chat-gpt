# Chat-gpt
ChatGPT


ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate human-like responses to user input. This project allows users to engage in a conversation with the AI assistant on any topic.


Installation


To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

openai
gradio
You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

Copy code


pip install openai gradio


Usage


To run this project, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
Run the chatgpt.py file using Python.
Copy code
python chatgpt.py
This will start the Gradio interface, where you can enter a message to the AI assistant and receive a response.

How It Works


The chatbot uses the GPT-3 model to generate a response to the user's input. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of text, allowing it to generate natural-sounding responses. The openai_create function sends the user's input as a prompt to the GPT-3 API, which returns a response. The response is then displayed to the user through the Gradio interface.

The chatgpt_clone function keeps track of the conversation history and generates a response based on the previous inputs and outputs. This allows the AI assistant to have a more natural conversation flow and to remember previous topics discussed.
